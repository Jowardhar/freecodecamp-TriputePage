                <p>Originally built only as a Coup√©, the 911 had an integral body-frame and was powered by a new 2.0-litre flat-six engine, which initially delivered 130 hp.
                    <br><br> The 911 S, the first engine derivative of the 911, was also launched on the market. In the years that followed, models bearing the additional designations T, L and E were launched.

                <p>Due to various engine modifications, the sports version of the 911 initially had a power output of 160 hp, ultimately increasing to 190 hp. In addition to superior equipment, the S model was the first 911 to be given "Fuchs" rims with
                    their distinctive 5-spoke design.</p>

                <p>The "Touring" version became the new entry-level model in the 911 family, initially developing 110 hp and later 130 hp. Its equipment matched that of the four-cylinder 912 model. One of the ways in which it could be distinguished from
                    more powerful models was the fact that it had a silver rather than a gold logo.</p>
